### Bio:

Starting from the tender age of 10, I became fascinated with everything computer-related, after playing my first computer game at a friends house - Sid Meyers Civilization, in glorious 16 colours.

The early nineties were a different time - home computers were still a rarity; even my school was not yet equipped with a single PC. But my grandfather, once he heard, that I had developed an interest, bought me a used x286 for my birthday, saying that while he would never learn to use a computer, he was sure that they were the future. Sadly, he didn't live to see his prediction come true.

Everything I wanted to do, I had to teach myself. As the years went by and computers became more common, I started to be the 'computer guy' for my friends and family. From installing Windows to teaching how to save a file...I was the go-to person. Sadly, even at the turn of the millennium, my school didn't offer much in the way of IT education. And while I still spent a lot of time in front of the screen, my professional interest changed, leading me to language and the humanities, and ultimately university courses in communications and anthropology.

It wasn't until years later, when I was in my mid-thirties, that I got the chance to renew my passion for the more technical side of IT. The AMS enrolled me in classes for web and graphics design, later a dedicated program for IT workers in Gmunden. Finally, I was accepted into the coders.bay program, where I hope to learn the skills on which to build a career on.
